          Feel Invincible
Skillet

Target on my back
Lone survivor lasts
They got me in their sights

No surrender
No trigger fingers go
Living the dangerous life

Hey hey hey everyday when I wake
I'm trying to get up
They're knocking me down
(Chewing me up spitting me out)

Hey hey hey when I need to be saved
You're making me strong
You're making me stand
(Never will fall never will end)

Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Nothing can stop me tonight

You make me feel invincible
Earthquake powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song raising up
Like a roar of victory in a stadium

Who can touch me cause I'm
(I'm made of fire)
Who can stop me tonight
(I'm hard wired)
You make me feel invincible

I feel I feel it
Invincible

I feel I feel it
Invincible

Here we go again
I will not give in
I've got a reason to fight

Every day we choose
We might win or lose
This is the dangerous life

Hey hey hey everyday when I wake
They say that I'm gone they say that they've won
(The bell has been rung it's over and done)

Hey hey hey when I need to be saved
They're counting me out but this is my round
(You in my corner look at me now)

Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Nothing can stop me tonight

You make me feel invincible
Earthquake powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song raising up
Like a roar of victory in a stadium

Who can touch me cause I'm
(I'm made of fire)
Who can stop me tonight
(I'm hard wired)
You make me feel invincible

I feel I feel it
Invincible

I feel I feel it
Invincible

You make me feel
Invincible

You make me feel
Invincible

Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Nothing can stop
Invincible

Feel invincible
Earthquake powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song raising up
Like a roar of victory in a stadium

Feel invincible
Earthquake powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song raising up

          Monster
Skillet

The secret side of me
I never let you see
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
So stay away from me
The beast is ugly
I feel the rage and I just can't hold it

It's scratchin on the walls
In the closet, in the halls
It comes awake and I can't control it
Hidin under the bed
In my body, in my head
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end

I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I hate what I've become
The nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

My secret side I keep
Hid under lock and key
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out
He'll tear me up, break me down
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end

I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I hate what I've become
The nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

It's hidin in the dark
It's teeth are razor sharp
There's no escape for me
It wants my soul, it wants my heart

No one can hear me scream
Maybe it's just a dream
Or maybe it's inside of me
Stop this monster

I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I hate what I've become
The nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I gotta lose control
Is something radical
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

          Comatose
Skillet

I hate feeling like this
I'm so tired of trying to fight this
I'm asleep and all I dream of
Is waking to You

Tell me that you will listen
Your touch is what I'm missing
And the more I hide I realize
I'm slowly losing You

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an
Overdose
Of You

I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breathe
'Less I feel You next to me
You take the pain I feel
Waking up to You never felt so real
I don't wanna sleep
I don't wanna dream
Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way You make me feel
Waking up to You never felt so real

I hate living without You
Dead wrong to ever doubt You
But my demons lay in waiting
Tempting me away
Oh how I adore You!
Oh how I thirst for You!
Oh how I need You!

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an
Overdose
Of You

I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breathe
'Less I feel You next to me
You take the pain I feel
Waking up to You never felt so real
I don't wanna sleep
I don't wanna dream
Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way You make me feel
Waking up to You never felt so real

Breathing life
Waking up
My eyes
Open up

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an
Overdose
Of You

I don't wanna live
I don't wanna breathe
'Less I feel You next to me
You take the pain I feel
Waking up to You never felt so real
I don't wanna sleep
I don't wanna dream
Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way You make me feel
Waking up to You never felt so real

Oh how I adore You!
Waking up to You never felt so real
Oh how I thirst for You!
Waking up to You never felt so real
Oh how I adore You

          Rise
Skillet

All I see is
Shattered pieces
I can't keep it hidden like a secret
I can't look away
From all this pain in a world we made!

Everyday you need
A bulletproof vest
To save yourself from what you could never guess!
Am I safe today?
When I step outside in the wars we wage!

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

Sound it off, this is the call
Rise in revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise in revolution
Unite and fight, to make a better life
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call, tonight, we rise

Rise
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise

Like a hand grenade
Thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos
Trying to escape the flame
Yesterday is gone
Faster than the blast of a car bomb

And when the scars heal
The pain passes
As hope burns, we rise from the ashes
Darkness fades away
And a light shines on a brave new day

Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown

Sound it off, this is the call
Rise in revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise in revolution
Unite and fight, to make a better life
Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call, tonight, we rise

Rise
Tonight, we rise
Rise
Tonight, we rise

In a world gone mad
In a place so sad
Sometimes it's crazy
To fight for what you believe
But you can't give up
If you wanna keep what you love
(Keep what you love)
(Keep what you love)
(Keep what you love)
(Keep what you love)
Never give up, no

Rise
Rise in revolution
Rise
Rise in revolution

Everybody one for all
Sound off, this is the call

Rise
Like we're alive
Tonight, we rise
Make a better life
Tonight, we rise

Rise, rise, rise in revolution
Rise, rise, rise in revolution
Rise

Maybe I'm just paranoid
Or maybe I'm just livin' a lie
Can't stop this screamin' voice
Or maybe I'm just sick inside

This is the face
I hate the other side of me
Out of this cage
He breaks to take the life from me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
I'm not crazy

There's a psycho in my head
I'm closer to the edge
Makin' me feel like I'm livin' in misery, misery
Insane
These voices in my brain
Startin' to feel like it's gonna be the death of me, death of me

There's a psycho in my, there's a psycho in my head

Livin' in hysteria
Nothin' makes much sense tonight
Maybe I'm too scared to trust
To stop the chaos in my mind

This is the face
I hate the other side of me
Help me believe
I need to see the light in me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Oh

My heart bleeds adrenaline
The fire I breathe is where I live
Say my name, incredible
Say my name, an animal
One life to live
I never give up, I never give in

Some people wanna turn and run (run)
But the strong rise under the gun

Top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
To the top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop

Never gonna keep me down (never keep me)
Still the one that's standin' now (never falling)
Destiny is callin' me
Go down in history
Every day I'll fight to be
Legendary
Legendary

Fly high or will I fall?
Legends made when faith is strong

Say my name, no time to plead
Say my name, I'm conquering
While I'm alive, I'll push through the pain, I'll run for the prize

Wings are made to fly, made to fly (made to fly)
Fears are born to die, born to die (born to die)
Pushin' through the pain, through the pain (through the pain)
Pushin' through, breakin' through
Whatever it takes, what I gotta do
Givin' my all, givin' all that I've got
Never will stop till I get to the top

          Not Gonna Die
Skillet

Death surrounds
My heartbeat's slowing down
I won't take this world's abuse
I won't give up, I refuse!

This is how it feels when you're bent and broken
This is how it feels when your dignity's stolen
When everything you love is leaving
You hold on to what you believe in

(The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye)
(And then I heard you flatline)
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever

(Don't close your eyes)
No, not gonna die tonight
We've gonna fight for us together
No, we're not gonna die tonight

Break their hold
'Cause I won't be controlled
They can't keep their chains on me
When the truth has set me free

This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you finally fight back
When life pushes me I push harder
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

(The last thing I heard is you whispering goodbye)
(And then I heard you flatline)
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever

(Don't close your eyes)
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we're not gonna die tonight

Don't you give up on me
You're everything I need
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you fight back

No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
(Don't close your eyes)
No, not gonna die tonight

We're gonna fight for us together
No, we're not gonna die tonight
No, we're not gonna die tonight
(Not gonna die)

(Not gonna die)
Not gonna die tonight
